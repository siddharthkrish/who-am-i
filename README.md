# Siddharth Krish - Engineering enthusiast
![work timeline](images/work_timeline.png)

I am an entrepreneur, technology enthusiast and an expert in building software products & teams. I have over 15 years of experience in creating products and managing multidisciplinary teams. I am wired to solve problems in highly cross-functional areas.

I have led various teams in both the technology world and outside with my primary focus being on building leaders who can easily take over and replace me. Having or building my own knowledge of the areas I manage has been critical to my ability to succeed in my role.

## What can I offer?
* I'm excellent at identifying the companies requirements and the gaps
* I get along well with almost everyone that I work with
* Having a long and proven track record of creating teams that perform at a very high level
* Lead by example & building consensus is my leadership style
* I'm rooting for the underdog which is another way of saying that my empathy for the people in the team usually translates to a motivated team that has the desire to work hard, have fun but constantly communicate
* I understand the importance of communication upwards, sideways and below.

## Work Experience
